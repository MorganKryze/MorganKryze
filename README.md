## 💻 About me

Currently at an engineering school, I get to use VsCode, Docker or Flutter. But what I like most currently is C# and its potential.
Through my different projects, I try to go further and further into the language and discover its specifics.

However, I'm not solely focused on C#. I try my best to learn dart/Flutter and Python on the side to stay competitive!

## 📁 Projects

### 🌄 ConsoleAppVisuals

This is my biggest project: a C# console app library that allows you to create a console app with a GUI. It's a work in progress and I'm trying to add new features as often as I can. The objective is to create both a useful and easy to use library for beginners and advanced developers.

### 📺 Computer Science Problem

I built this project for my computer science class. The goal was to create a C# app that can create fractals, manipulate bitmap images (convolution, filters, ...) and switch languages (french and english). I also added a few other features like a custom color picker, a custom file explorer and a custom console.

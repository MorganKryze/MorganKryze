## 📁 Projects

### 🌄 ConsoleAppVisuals

By far one of my most ambitious coding project: a C# console app library that allows you to create a console app with a rich Terminal User Interface. It's a work in progress and I'm trying to add new features and maintain it to keep it up to date. The objective is to create both a useful and easy to use library for beginners and intermediate developers.

> “The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code. Note that I used the word failure. I meant it. Comments are always failures. We must have them because we cannot always figure out how to express ourselves without them, but their use is not a cause for celebration. So when you find yourself in a position where you need to write a comment, think it through and see whether there isn’t some way to turn the tables and express yourself in code.”

## 💻 About me

Currently at an engineering school, I get to use VsCode, Docker or Flutter. But what I like most currently is C# and its potential.
Through my different projects, I try to go further and further into the language and discover its specifics.

However, I'm not solely focused on C#. I try my best to learn dart/Flutter and Python on the side to stay competitive!
